# CableGenerator — Usage Guide

## 1. Overview

CableGenerator is a Unity Editor extension that generates procedural meshes along Bezier splines in real time. It is designed primarily for VRChat world creation and can produce cables, pipes, roads, or any other shape with a consistent cross-section extruded along a 3D path.

**Key features:**

- Real-time mesh rebuild whenever the spline is edited
- Fully customizable cross-section via `CableProfile` ScriptableObjects (open/closed extension)
- Scene View interactive handles for control points and tangents
- Spline setup tools: 2-point surface picking, knot subdivision, sag simulation, surface projection
- Automatic lightmap UV (UV1) packing
- One-click baked mesh export as `.asset`
- Full Undo/Redo support for every operation

**Requirements:**

- Unity 2022 or later
- Unity Splines package
- Unity.Mathematics package

## 2. Basic Usage

### 2.1 Create a Cable Object

From the Unity menu bar:

```
GameObject > Cable Generator > Create Cable
```

A `Cable` GameObject is created with the following components pre-configured:

| Component | Role |
|---|---|
| `SplineContainer` | Holds the Bezier spline (2 default knots) |
| `MeshFilter` | Receives the generated mesh |
| `MeshRenderer` | Renders the mesh (default material applied) |
| `CableGenerator` | Drives the mesh generation |

### 2.2 Assign and Configure a Cross-Section Profile

A cross-section profile is a `CableProfile` ScriptableObject asset that defines the shape of the cable when cut. This shape is extruded along the spline to generate the mesh. No mesh is generated until a profile is assigned.

#### 2.2.1 Create a Profile Asset

Right-click in the Project window or use the top menu:
```
Create > CableGenerator > Profiles > [Profile Type]
```
An asset file will be created. You can rename it as desired.

The available profile types and their typical use cases:

| Menu Option | Cross-Section Shape | Example Use Case |
|---|---|---|
| **Heavy Duty Cable Profile** | Circular (thick round) with optional ribbing | Power cables, hoses, pipes |
| **Flat Cable Profile** | Rounded rectangle (flat shape) | Flat cables, ribbon cables, belts |
| **Parallel Wire Profile** | Two circles joined (figure-eight shape) | Dual-core wires, speaker cables |
| **Bundled Cable Profile** | Multiple circular wires arranged in a row | Data cable bundles, LAN cables |
| **Clustered Cable Profile** | Multiple circular wires packed concentrically | Multi-core cables, bundles inside conduits |

#### 2.2.2 Configure Profile Parameters

Select the created profile asset in the Project window to view and adjust its parameters in the Inspector.

**Heavy Duty Cable Profile:**
- **Radius**: Radius of the cable. Recommended: `0.01` to `0.1` m.
- **Segments**: Number of divisions around the circumference. Higher is smoother. Recommended: `8` to `32`.
- **Rib Count**: Number of ridges/ribs. Set to `0` for a smooth circle. Recommended: `0` to `12`.
- **Rib Depth**: Depth of the ribs relative to the radius. Recommended: `0` to `0.3`.

**Flat Cable Profile:**
- **Width**: Total width (X-axis length). Recommended: `0.05` to `0.2` m.
- **Thickness**: Total thickness (Y-axis length). Recommended: `0.01` to `0.05` m.
- **Corner Radius**: Radius of the rounded corners. Recommended: `0.003` to `0.01` m.
- **Corner Segments**: Number of divisions for the rounded corners. Recommended: `2` to `4`.

**Parallel Wire Profile:**
- **Wire Radius**: Radius of each individual wire. Recommended: `0.01` to `0.03` m.
- **Spacing**: Distance between the centers of the two wires. Recommended: `0.04` to `0.08` m.
- **Segments**: Number of divisions for each circle. Recommended: `6` to `16`.

**Bundled Cable Profile:**
- **Wire Count**: Number of wires. Recommended: `1` to `24`.
- **Wire Radius**: Radius of each individual wire. Recommended: `0.005` to `0.03` m.
- **Gap**: Gap/spacing between wires. Recommended: `0` to `0.01` m.
- **Segments**: Number of divisions for each circle. Recommended: `4` to `32`.

**Clustered Cable Profile:**
- **Wire Count**: Number of wires. Recommended: `1` to `37`.
- **Wire Radius**: Radius of each individual wire. Recommended: `0.005` to `0.02` m.
- **Segments**: Number of divisions for each circle. Recommended: `4` to `32`.
- **Jitter**: Random displacement of wire positions. Recommended: `0` to `0.5`.
- **Radius Jitter**: Random variation in wire radii. Recommended: `0` to `0.3`.
- **Seed**: Random seed to reproduce the same layout.

#### 2.2.3 Assign the Profile to Cable Generator

1. Select the **Cable object** in the Scene View or Hierarchy.
2. In the **CableGenerator** Inspector, assign the created profile to the **断面プロファイル (Cross-Section Profile)** field using one of the following methods:
   - **Drag & Drop**: Drag the profile asset from the Project window to the field.
   - **Picker**: Click the circle selector (◎) icon on the right side of the field and choose it from the list.

**The mesh is generated and displayed immediately upon assignment.**

### 2.3 Edit the Spline Shape

Select the Cable object and open the Scene View. The following handles appear:

- **Colored spheres** — one per control point (knot). Color indicates tangent mode (see §3.3).
- **Blue / orange sphere handles** extending from each knot — tangent (In / Out).
- **Yellow polyline** — spline preview.
- **[N] / [N]▶ / ◀[N] labels** — knot index displayed above each knot. The start knot shows **[N]▶** and the end knot shows **◀[N]**.

| Action | How |
|---|---|
| Move a control point | Drag the Position Handle (XYZ arrows) at the knot |
| Move a tangent | Drag the blue (In) or orange (Out) sphere |
| Select a knot | Click the colored sphere in Scene View |
| Multi-select knots | Hold **Shift** and click additional spheres |

### 2.4 Add and Remove Control Points

In the **SplineContainer** Inspector, use the **制御点リスト (Control Point List)**:

- **＋ 制御点を追加** — adds a knot after the currently selected one. If a middle knot is selected, the new knot is inserted at the midpoint between that knot and the next. If the last knot is selected, the new knot is placed 2 m in the outgoing tangent direction.
- **×** on any row — deletes that knot (requires at least 2 knots; button is disabled when only 2 remain).

### 2.5 Adjust Mesh Quality

| Parameter | Where | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| 分割数（滑らかさ） | CableGenerator Inspector | Ring segment count along the spline (2–256). Higher = smoother curves. |
| UVタイリング | CableGenerator Inspector | V-axis tiling of UV0. Increase to repeat the texture more often along the cable. |

### 2.6 Export a Baked Mesh

When the cable shape is finalized, export it for VRChat:

1. Expand **エクスポート** in the CableGenerator Inspector.
2. (Optional) Click **...** to choose a folder inside `Assets/`. If left blank the default output folder is used.
3. Click **メッシュを保存 (.asset)**.

What happens:

- The mesh is saved as a `.asset` file.
- A new `<Name>_cable_baked` GameObject is created at the same position/rotation/scale with the baked mesh and the same materials.
- The original Cable object is tagged `EditorOnly` and deactivated — it will be excluded from VRChat builds automatically.

## 4. Q&A

**Q: The mesh does not appear after creating the Cable object.**  
A: A `CableProfile` asset must be assigned in the **断面プロファイル** field. No mesh is generated without it.

**Q: 2-point picking does not register my clicks.**  
A: The target meshes must have a Collider component. Open the target mesh's Inspector and add a `MeshCollider`. Primitive colliders (Box, Capsule, Sphere) work but may produce inaccurate orientations.

**Q: The sag sliders stopped working.**  
A: Sag-adjustment mode exits whenever the spline structure changes (undo, adding/removing knots, etc.). Click **たわみノットを挿入** again to re-enter it.

**Q: How do I create a custom cross-section shape?**  
A: Subclass `CableProfile` in the `CableGeneratorRuntime` namespace, implement `GetVertices()`, `GetNormals()`, and `GetUCoords()`, and add `[CreateAssetMenu]`. No changes to `CableGenerator` or the Inspector are needed.

**Q: Can I make a closed loop (e.g., a ring)?**  
A: Yes. In the **SplineContainer** Inspector, enable the **ループ** toggle in the Stats Bar. The spline will close, and the mesh will connect the last segment back to the first.

**Q: The mesh has a twist at sharp bends.**  
A: This can happen when the spline tangent flips direction at a tight corner. Try adding an intermediate knot near the bend, then manually adjust its rotation in the **ノット詳細** panel to remove the twist.

**Q: How do I undo an operation?**  
A: Every operation — moving knots, adding/removing knots, projection, sag insertion, export — is registered with Unity's Undo system. Use **Ctrl+Z** (Windows) or **Cmd+Z** (Mac).

**Q: The baked mesh and the original cable both appear after export.**  
A: After export, the original object is tagged `EditorOnly` and set inactive. It will not be included in VRChat builds. If it is still visible in Edit mode, check the Hierarchy — the object should show as inactive (greyed out).

**Q: The lightmap UV (UV1) appears stretched.**  
A: UV1 is auto-packed from the profile perimeters and spline length using a shelf-packing algorithm. For very high aspect-ratio cables, packing may not be ideal. As a workaround, manually unwrap and bake UV1 in an external DCC tool after exporting the mesh asset.

**Q: Can I assign an FBX file directly to the attachment prefab field?**  
A: Yes. The `prefab` field on `CableKnotAttachment` accepts both `.prefab` files and non-prefabbed `.fbx` model assets. Drag the FBX from the Project window and drop it onto the field. `.prefab` files are instantiated with a Prefab connection preserved; `.fbx` model assets are instantiated directly without one.

**Q: Can I drive the cable shape from a script at runtime?**  
A: Yes. `CableGenerator` listens to `Spline.Changed` events, so modifying the `SplineContainer` programmatically will trigger an automatic rebuild. The component uses `[ExecuteAlways]`, so it also responds in Edit mode.
